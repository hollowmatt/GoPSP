# Grokking Algorithms

## Chapter 1: Binary Search
The first chapter is about binary search.  
This algorithm is in /binary/binary.go

## Chapter 2: Selection Sort
The second chapter is about selection sort.  
This algorithm is in /selection/selection.go

## Chapter 3: Recursion (not an Algorithm)
The third chapter is about recursion.  
This code is in /recursion/recursion.go

## Chapter 4: Quick Sort
The fourth chapter is about quick sort.  
This algorithm is in /quicksort/quicksort.go

## Chapter 5: Hashtables
The fifth chapter is about hashtables, but we don't need to really do anything there.
In Go, to define a hashtable, we use map - which is a hashtable behind it.
Define it with:

```
var m map[string]int  //define a map, with a key of string, value of int
m = make(map[string]int)  //this will initialize a map in Go
m["route"] = 66
```
